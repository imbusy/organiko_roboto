"""
Geometric inversion maps each point P_1 on a plane to another point P_2 on the plane that is
an "inverse" of the first point with respect to some reference circle with center O such that
OP_1 * OP_2 = R^2 where OP_x is the distance from the center of the reference circle to point
P_x and R is the radius of the reference circle.

For this visualization, we will assume that the reference circle is at the origin (0,0).
